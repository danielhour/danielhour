From collegiate golf to million dollar bowl game budgets to tech industry vet. It's been an odd journey and it's fun to look back on it & remember what I've done.                                                              |

I decided it would be more impactful to put the story down in writing.                                                                                                                                               |
| [The Sneaker Contest Reimagined](https://medium.com/goatgroupengineering/the-sneaker-contest-reimagined-71a4e2f5aa0d) | GOAT’s Black Friday contest is the largest digital sneaker event of the year. We hosted our first Black Friday drawing in 2015, just a few months after we launched the GOAT app.                                                                                                                                     |
| [Serverless Bookmarks on iOS](/blog/serverless-bookmarks-on-ios/post.md)                                              | Bookmarks & Favoriting - an essential tool for both shoppers and retailers in the world of e-commerce. But what if there isn't enough time to spin up an entire backend service for it?                                                                                                                               |
| [Introducing Pixelfits](/blog/introducing-pixelfits/post.md)                                                          | The idea blossomed when Apple opened up its “subject lifting” API, which magically lifts subjects out of images through a touch & hold interaction.                                                                                                                                                                   |

It's also a bit of a personal journey for me – from a dismissive "design, schmesign" attitude to a full-on "aha, so this is what it's all about" moment. |
| [Exploring New APIs w/ Pixelfits](/blog/exploring-new-api/post.md)                                                    | Whenever inspiration strikes for a new app, I blend the latest Apple APIs with technologies unexplored in my day job. This approach sharpens my skills, keeping me engaged with the evolving iOS landscape and its array of new tools.                                                                                |
