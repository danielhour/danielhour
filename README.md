From collegiate golf to million dollar bowl game budgets to tech industry vet. It's been an odd journey and it's fun to look back on it & remember what I've done.                                                              |

It's also a bit of a personal journey for me ‚Äì from a dismissive "design, schmesign" attitude to a full-on "aha, so this is what it's all about" moment. |

This approach sharpens my skills, keeping me engaged with the evolving iOS landscape and its array of new tools.                                                                                |
