From collegiate golf to million dollar bowl game budgets to tech industry vet. It's been an odd journey and it's fun to look back on it & remember what I've done.                                                              |

I decided it would be more impactful to put the story down in writing.                                                                                                                                               |

It's also a bit of a personal journey for me – from a dismissive "design, schmesign" attitude to a full-on "aha, so this is what it's all about" moment. |
