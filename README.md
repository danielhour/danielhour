I decided it would be more impactful to put the story down in writing.                                                                  |

We hosted our first Black Friday drawing in 2015, just a few months after we launched the GOAT app.                                                        |

From collegiate golf to million dollar bowl game budgets to tech industry vet. There will hopefully be constant additions as I remember/create important moments. |
