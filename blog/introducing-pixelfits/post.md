# Introducing Pixelfits: Your Virtual 2D Fitting Room

Alex Fortney and I released an App! We're thrilled to present Pixelfits – your go-to virtual 2D fitting room. Check it out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelfits/id6469011331) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pixelfits.app).

The idea was born when Apple opened up its [subject-lifting API](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10176/) at WWDC23, which magically lifts subjects out of images through a touch & hold interaction.
Its introduction immediately reminded me of this [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/gNH9ba9aWd0) I've been enamored with since my days at [GOAT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goat-sneakers-apparel/id966758561). Forget the overkill of 3D modeling kits and AR try-ons. Sometimes, the joy of shopping is in the simplicity – like seeing how those Kobe reverse grinches would look on you before you make the purchase.

But unlike that video, why limit this fun to just shoes or paper cutouts? With Pixelfits, we bring this excitement to all kinds of clothing. Our aim is simple: to make your online fashion exploration as delightful and straightforward as possible.

Using Pixelfits is a breeze. While browsing online, find a piece of clothing that catches your eye, share the image to Pixelfits, and you immediately get to see how it looks and fits, all in a fun and interactive way! See the demo below!
