#  How I Taught Myself to Code

I’ve been asked more than a few times about how I engineered such a wide left turn in my career from athletic administration to iOS Developer so I decided it would be more impactful to put the story down in writing. I’ve structured it in a “timeline” format so you can find what’s most relevant to you for where you are in your journey.

### @ Minus-5 Months 
_TLDR; It's time to move on_

I spent 10 years in an industry that was beginning to feel repetitive, unethical (reaping the rewards of unpaid labor from collegiate athletes) and Trumpian (those in charge were not necessarily of sound mind nor the most intelligent).

**I wanted to venture into something more creative where my day-to-day would be less “scripted” & more nuanced. So I took the leap, quit the only industry I ever knew and attempted to start my own company. I went looking for engineers that would build my vision for me on the cheap and surprisingly, I found them!**

So we spent the next few months laying the groundwork & building the wireframe for what would, sadly, never come.

————————————
### @ Minus-2 Months 
_TLDR; Crisis of confidence_

As previously hinted, after 3 months of planning, the dev shop I hired ended up cancelling the contract because they couldn’t do it for the price we had originally agreed upon. It was ABSOLUTELY GUT-WRENCHING.

I bring this up because it is around this point in your journey where you are going to realize a few things. Mainly that you voluntarily walked away from:  
- _a steady paycheck_  
- _health insurance_  
- _industry network_  

And in my case, since I had little to no coding experience, I had no hard skills to offer the world. Not ideal! lol. **Breathe through it.**

But after that pity party you throw for yourself (which you’re [allowed a little bit of](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/nick-sabans-24-hour-rule-is-key-to-success-in-sports-business.html)), you say, **“OK, fuck this! I don’t want to ever want to feel this powerless again. I guess I’m going to just have to bootstrap it & teach myself how to code because there is literally no other choice.”**

Or as Al Swearengen of Deadwood would say:

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRxQe34leFE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

_“Pain or damage don't end the world. Or despair, or fucking beatings. The world ends when you're dead. Until then, you've got more punishment in store. Stand it like a man... and give some back.”_

————————————
### @ Minus-1 Month 
_TLDR; Picking the right language (for me)_

Now that the decision to teach yourself how to code is made, you have to choose a language. For me, I had 2 guiding principles in that decision-making process:

1. **I want to be able to completely build a fully-featured product on my own**  
2. **I want to focus on only ONE language**  
- _I’m already behind enough as it is, learning multiple languages would be an insurmountable feat (speaking only for myself here)._  

**Which then eliminated a few things right off the bat:**  
- Backend: because as important as data is, you still need a front-end for it
- Web: HTML, CSS, Javascript - 3 languages to get 1 product out the door  
- DevOps: I wanted to built a consumer product so this was not in play either  

So that really only left me with one discipline and that was mobile development & seeing as how I switched from a PC to a Mac in 2005 and have never looked back, it was iOS all the way.

Besides the whole “don’t know how to code” part, the only real concern was  - well, apps still need a backend so what are we going to do about data? There is this wonderful thing called [Backend-as-a-service (BaaS)](https://firebase.google.com/) where 3rd-party companies will essentially act as your data storage and provide you with an interface, documentation, etc for those that have no coding experience.

_SIDEBAR:_ A fortuitous decision by Apple to release an entirely new programming language called Swift the day AFTER I decided on learning iOS really helped narrow my focus.

I went all-in on Swift even though I knew it wouldn’t be ready for another year or two because I wanted to play as little catch up as possible. I knew I’d be sacrificing opportunities in the short-term, but that was ok because

1. I wasn’t ready for those opportunities anyways and 
2. psychologically, this would feel like I was ahead of the curve instead of 10-20 years behind the curve.

_Extra Sidebar Story:_ This is how our coach used to recruit when he would become the head coach at a new university. He would sacrifice the first year and focus intently on 2-3 years ahead so that he wasn’t ever playing “catch-up”. I always remembered this anecdote & I took it to heart haha.

### @ 0 Months 
_TLDR; Welcome to the University of Google_

Now comes the hard part - sitting down and seeing if I could actually do the work. **I am not a great book learner but luckily for me, I already had a project / intention in mind. This was helpful for me because it gave me a very clear purpose.** So my “process” then became this extremely frustrating yet rewarding internal dialogue x100,000:

**Ok I want to implement Feature A. How do I do it?**  
_( Google / StackOverflow it )_  
**Oh crap. Feature A actually requires 100 mini-steps in between. What is Step A1?**  
_( Google / StackOverflow it )_  
**How do I implement Step A1?**  
( Google / StackOverflow it )  
**Ok, I asked that incorrectly - ask about Step A1 again but with broader terms.**  
( Google / StackOverflow it )  
**Implement Step A1 - but did I implement it correctly?**  
No.  
**How about now?**  
Lol no. Even worse.  
**Ah got it! How about now?**  
Dude seriously - just throw your computer away & quit.  
**Repeat until Step A1 works.**  
Oh yay! It finally works!  
**Ok now on to Step A2.**  
**Repeat until you get to Step A100 before moving to Feature B.**  
And now Feature B included 5000 mini-steps in between.

Do not despair. Just keep Googling.

There will be numerous times where you will feel like you’re hitting a wall (or actually want to hit the wall) & losing your mind like Natasha Lyonne here in Russian Doll. It’s ok.

**It’s supposed to be this difficult in the beginning.** 

You’re essentially learning a foreign language AND reprogramming the way your mind logically approaches problems & solutions. AT THE SAME TIME!

**It’s an incredibly steep hill in the beginning but there will come a point where that hill does shallow out a little bit.**

### @ 4 Months 
_TLDR; Wait, this is fun - bootcamp time!_

The original goal was to learn enough code to build a beta product (a recruiting app to help student-athletes), use my coaching & athlete network to onboard users, raise funding to start a company and then transition OUT of being a developer.

But a peculiar thing happened during those first four months - I had fun. Like a lot of fun. There was even a specific MOMENT that is clearly etched in my memory where even I had to acknowledge **“ok there might be a future here because this is actually the most fun I’ve had in a really long time”**.

STORY TIME: I was still living in Seattle at a time and had made my nightly trek to the Greenlake coffee shop. It was around 9/930PM and it had been a pretty frustrating week because I was stuck on a concept that was not making any sense to me.

And then an hour or so after sitting down, it magically clicked. After a week of running into dead ends, I finally got the code to do what I wanted it to do & I saw the UI come to life.

And I will tell you, that moment felt better than the one and only golf tournament I won when I was fifteen. There was an intense feeling of accomplishment rather than a sense of relief (which is usually what I felt after finishing a round of competitive golf).

![article_50](/blog/teaching-myself-how-to-code/assets/happy-gilmore.gif)

Now, I tell this story because then and ONLY then was when I was like “ok there maybe something here for me - I should spend the money on a bootcamp.” 

I really stress this moment because I think a lot of people look at tech salaries and immediately go “yes - I want to be a developer!” But until you’ve beaten your head against the wall, cursed at your computer, sworn off coding completely… and then sadistically come back to it the next day and try to solve the same stupid problem you were trying to solve the days before (similar to to golf), you’re not going to know if this is really what you want to do and I’d hate for anyone to waste their money on a tech bootcamp if it ends up being something you don’t end up wanting to do.

————————————
### @ 8 Months 
_TLDR; Finding your 1st job with no formal education_

So at this point, we’re eight months in and I’ve had my coffee shop epiphany & I’ve also completed the coding bootcamp. Despite the bootcamp “job guarantee” that most of these places promote - I knew I wasn’t going to get any real gigs with just a bootcamp certificate on my resume.

So instead of applying to any well-known or established tech companies / startups, I went digging through AngelList applying to every unknown 1-10 person company. From my previous experiences of running a recruiting department with barely any funding for your salary, sometimes you just need a warm body where grit is valued over current knowledge.

Getting the first job is the hardest. It gets easier from there (kinda).

Through this application process, I found a scrappy 2-person company that was working out of an incubator that housed 4 other companies. I drove from Buena Park to Venice (a 1.5 hour commute by LA standards) every other day for $20 / hour but none of that mattered for these two reasons:

I was getting real world dev experience to put some substance on the CV

The only other employee was a fairly senior iOS developer which meant I was going to pester this guy with all of my n00b questions all day and get a free education (Forever grateful Rocky!)

————————————
### @ 12 Months 
_TLDR; Building momentum_

After four months at that startup, I went looking for another gig that could offer me a real full-time position. I still kept my search at the 1-10 person level because I was still only one job removed from a bootcamp. Therefore I was still looking for a company that placed a higher value on grit than actual iOS knowledge but at least I personally knew that I could handle it & contribute more.

————————————
### @ 16 Months 
_TLDR; Building momentum continued_

I think at this point, the rest of the journey will be up to the individual but I know for me, this was around the time when I felt ready to apply to more mature startups (10-50 people). With 2 real developer jobs under my belt, it felt far enough removed from being in a bootcamp where that no “lack of formal education” was no longer an issue or at least could not be held against me.

Other challenges will definitely pop up like when a startup runs out of money or when you run into bad management but those are divergent of what this piece’s purpose is (I may / may not write about those experiences in another post 😉) .

So in conclusion… this was my year-long onboarding ramp to how I taught myself to code & become a professional developer! If you questions not addressed here or want to dive even deeper into these details, I am more than happy to help!

### Currently @ 72 Months 
_TLDR; Five startups later..._

And for those are curious, I have been at GOAT the last 3 years and have seen the company grow from 20 engineers to 150+! Insane!

I was even asked by the company to write a piece for the GOAT engineering blog which while difficult, was a pretty nice piece of validation on where I started and how far I’ve come!
